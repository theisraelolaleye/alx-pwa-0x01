## API Overview

The MoviesDatabase API (e.g. The Movie Database, TMDb) is a RESTful web service that provides detailed metadata for movies, TV shows, and people (actors, directors). It supports searching, fetching details, discovering by filters, images, credits, and more. Developers can use it to power apps, websites, or services that need movie and TV show information (titles, ratings, cast, poster images, etc.).


The **MoviesDatabase** API (hosted on RapidAPI by user SAdrian) offers a comprehensive database of movies, TV shows, episodes, and people (actors, crew). It claims to cover over **9 million titles** and **11 million actors/crew members**, and provides metadata such as full biographies, awards, YouTube trailer URLs, cast/crew credits, images, and more. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}  

Use cases include:

- Searching for movies or shows by name  
- Fetching detailed info (title, synopsis, release date, cast, etc.)  
- Getting credits / cast & crew for a given title  
- Accessing images, videos/trailers, awards, and related metadata  
- Querying by ID or slug  

This API is geared toward developers building movie / entertainment apps or dashboards.

## Version

The documentation on RapidAPI doesn’t explicitly call out a version number (e.g. “v1”, “v2”). The API is presented under RapidAPI’s “MoviesDatabase” listing. (If you see a version tag in the RapidAPI UI, you should include it here.)

## Available Endpoints

Below is a conceptual list of the core endpoints (names based on RapidAPI’s “Endpoints” section). You’ll want to check the RapidAPI UI for exact paths, query parameters, and response schemas.

- `GET /movie/{movie_id}` — fetch full details for a movie (title, overview, release, genres, etc.)  
- `GET /movie/{movie_id}/credits` — get cast & crew info for a movie  
- `GET /movie/{movie_id}/videos` or `trailers` — fetch trailers or YouTube links  
- `GET /movie/{movie_id}/images` — fetch poster, backdrop images  
- `GET /tv/{tv_id}` — fetch full details for a TV show  
- `GET /tv/{tv_id}/credits` — cast & crew for the TV show  
- `GET /person/{person_id}` — fetch biographical info on an actor / director  
- `GET /search/movie` — search movies by title or partial match  
- `GET /search/tv` — search TV series by name  
- `GET /discover/movie` — filter / discover by criteria (genre, year, rating)  
- Possibly auxiliary endpoints like `/awards`, `/genres`, or `/similar` (depending on what the API supports)  

You should check the “Endpoints” tab on the RapidAPI UI for exact endpoint paths, query parameter names, and supported HTTP methods. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  

## Request and Response Format

### Request Format

- All requests are made via HTTPS  
- Use the RapidAPI host/domain (as given in the RapidAPI UI)  
- You will include path parameters (e.g. `movie_id`) and query parameters  
- Common query parameters might include `language`, `page`, `region`, filters, etc.  
- Authentication (API key) is passed via headers (see below)  

Example of a request (pseudo-URL):

```

GET [https://moviesdatabase.p.rapidapi.com/movie/12345?language=en-US](https://moviesdatabase.p.rapidapi.com/movie/12345?language=en-US)

```

Plus headers such as:

```

X-RapidAPI-Key: YOUR_RAPIDAPI_KEY
X-RapidAPI-Host: moviesdatabase.p.rapidapi.com

````

RapidAPI typically provides “Code Snippets” in many languages (Node.js, Python, curl, etc.) for each endpoint in its UI. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  

### Sample Response

Here is a hypothetical (simplified) response schema for a “movie details” endpoint:

```json
{
  "id": 12345,
  "title": "Inception",
  "original_title": "Inception",
  "overview": "A thief who …",
  "release_date": "2010-07-16",
  "genres": [
    { "id": 28, "name": "Action" },
    { "id": 878, "name": "Science Fiction" }
  ],
  "poster_path": "/path/to/poster.jpg",
  "backdrop_path": "/path/to/backdrop.jpg",
  "vote_average": 8.3,
  "vote_count": 36500,
  "cast": [  // possibly via append or via /credits endpoint
    { "id": 6193, "name": "Leonardo DiCaprio", "character": "Dom Cobb" },
    { "id": 24045, "name": "Joseph Gordon-Levitt", "character": "Arthur" }
  ],
  "crew": [
    { "id": 525, "name": "Christopher Nolan", "job": "Director" },
    { "id": 528, "name": "Hans Zimmer", "job": "Music" }
  ],
  "videos": [
    { "type": "Trailer", "site": "YouTube", "key": "YoHD9XEInc0" }
  ]
  // possibly many more fields (runtime, production companies, etc.)
}
````

In TypeScript, you might define interfaces like:

```ts
interface Genre {
  id: number;
  name: string;
}

interface Video {
  type: string;
  site: string;
  key: string;
}

interface CastMember {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  character: string;
}

interface CrewMember {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  job: string;
}

interface MovieDetailsResponse {
  id: number;
  title: string;
  original_title?: string;
  overview: string;
  release_date: string;
  genres: Genre[];
  poster_path?: string;
  backdrop_path?: string;
  vote_average: number;
  vote_count: number;
  cast?: CastMember[];
  crew?: CrewMember[];
  videos?: Video[];
  // … more optional fields
}
```

You’ll want to refer to the exact response schemas in RapidAPI to capture required vs optional, nullable fields, nested objects, etc.

## Authentication

Because this is a RapidAPI–hosted API, you must:

1. Subscribe to the API (choose a plan) in RapidAPI
2. Use your **X-RapidAPI-Key** header with your RapidAPI key
3. Include the **X-RapidAPI-Host** header with the host value shown in the RapidAPI UI

For example, HTTP headers:

```
X-RapidAPI-Key: your_api_key_here
X-RapidAPI-Host: moviesdatabase.p.rapidapi.com
```

RapidAPI handles routing of your request to the backend API provider. The key ensures your usage is tracked and billed (if applicable). ([RapidAPI][1])

## Error Handling

When making API requests, you may encounter HTTP status codes and structured error responses. Some common patterns:

* **401 Unauthorized** – invalid or missing API key
* **403 Forbidden** – your plan might not allow access to that endpoint
* **404 Not Found** – requested resource (movie, person) does not exist
* **400 Bad Request** – invalid parameters (e.g. bad format, invalid filter)
* **429 Too Many Requests** – rate limit exceeded
* **5xx Server Error** – issues on the backend server

The response body often includes an error message, status code, or error description field. For example:

```json
{
  "status": "error",
  "message": "Movie not found",
  "code": 404
}
```

In your TypeScript code, you should:

1. Check the HTTP status code
2. Parse the JSON body
3. If status is error, throw a typed error (e.g. `NotFoundError`, `RateLimitError`)
4. For 5xx or rate-limit issues, consider retry logic with exponential backoff
5. Gracefully degrade or surface errors to the UI (if applicable)

## Usage Limits and Best Practices

* RapidAPI plans often impose **rate limits** (requests per minute / per day) depending on your subscription tier
* Always check your usage dashboard on RapidAPI and monitor response headers (sometimes they include rate limit remaining)
* Cache results locally (especially for movie details or credits) to reduce redundant API calls
* Use query parameters to restrict / filter response fields (if supported)
* Combine sub-resources (if the API supports appending multiple segments) to reduce number of HTTP requests
* Handle pagination properly (if endpoints like “search” return pages)
* Avoid over-fetching — only request what you need
* Use exponential backoff and jitter for retrying failed requests
* Respect API versioning and deprecation notices from RapidAPI
* Log errors and failing requests for debugging and metrics

If you like, I can fetch the *exact* endpoint list + request/response schemas from the RapidAPI MoviesDatabase UI and produce a fully accurate README + corresponding TypeScript interface definitions. Do you want me to do that for you?
